This test is a step up from rewrite_empty, in that there are minimal values to
copy between source and destination, but it prints every time it enters & exits
recurse.  This tests the runtime's ability to correctly set up the stack and
correctly reproduce all frames, i.e., not skip any frames.

Expected output for default run:
--------------------------------

Entering recurse (1)
Entering recurse (2)
Entering recurse (3)
Entering recurse (4)
Entering recurse (5)
Entering recurse (6)
Entering recurse (7)
Entering recurse (8)
Entering recurse (9)
Entering recurse (10)
