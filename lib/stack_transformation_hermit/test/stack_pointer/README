This test passes a pointer to a stack-allocated variable up the call chain,
incrementing its value for every time recurse() is called.  This tests the
runtime's ability to detect pointers to the stack, and its ability to reify
those pointers once the pointed-to data is relocated.

Expected output for default run:
--------------------------------

myvar = 10
