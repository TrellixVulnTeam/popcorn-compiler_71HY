This test stores a value in a callee-saved register, recurses down the call
chain, and re-uses the value after returning.  This tests the runtime's ability
to detect values in callee-saved registers and place them in the correct
callee-saved slot or outermost activation register set.

Expected output for default run:
--------------------------------

Expected 12345678deadbeef, got 12345678deadbeef
