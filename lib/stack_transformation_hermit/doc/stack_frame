Call Frame Information
----------------------

A call frame activation is composed of three components:

1. A code location (i.e. a PC) -- where/which function the thread was executing

2. A call frame (i.e. stack frame), identified by the canonical frame address
   (defined below)

3. A set of registers (in particular, their values) at the specified code
   location

(C)anonical (F)rame (A)ddress -- CFA
------------------------------------

The CFA is an address on the stack which identifies a particular call frame
activation.  From the DWARF standard:

"Typically, the CFA is defined to be the value of the stack pointer at the call
site in the previous frame (which may be different from its value on entry to
the current frame)."

In the generalized view of the call frame below, n arguments are passed from
the caller to the callee -- m arguments are passed in registers and the
remaining n-m are passed on the stack.  The bottom of the on-stack argument
list (past the red zone on x86-64) is the CFA.  Note that on x86-64, this is
the value of the stack-pointer BEFORE the call instruction (per the quote
above), as the call instruction pushes the return address onto the stack.
Below the return address are the callee-saved registers and (l-k) local
variables, where l is the total number of local variables and k of them are
stored in registers (the remaining l-k must be stored on the stack).

Note that many of these locations can change depending on how far we've
progressed through the function, e.g. an argument in a register may no longer
be live and will be clobbered when the compiler promotes a local variable into
its place.
