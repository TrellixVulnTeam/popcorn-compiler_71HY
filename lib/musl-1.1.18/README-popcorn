Overview
--------

The musl-libc library is a clean but full-featured C library designed as an
alternative to glibc.  Rather than using glibc (which is complex, contains a
large amount of assembly, and is hard to modify), we used musl-libc as our
multi-ISA libc implementation.  All applications built using the Popcorn
compiler toolchain use musl as their libc implementation, which provides the
standard C library (libc), libm and libpthread.  All standard libc/libm/pthread
functionality is available for applications.

We made several modifications to the library in order to support multi-ISA
binaries and to help migration between architectures:

- We modified musl's TLS implementation to handle the changes made to gold to
  lay TLS out in an identical format between all architectures
  
- We removed futex system calls from the pthread implementation (used as the
  synchronization primitive for many pthread constructs, e.g., condition
  variables) as futex is not yet well-supported by the OS.  Note that calls to
  futex are replaced by a spinlock, which may provide bad performance for some
  applications.

- We added several pthread APIs to save/restore information needed by threads
  post-migration
  
- We changed the default thread stack size for cloned threads from 80kB to 8MB
  to match Linux's default stack size for the main thread
