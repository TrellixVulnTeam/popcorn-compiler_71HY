This test generates a set of random values for each invocation of recurse(),
continues recursion down to the outermost frame, and then re-uses the values
upon returning.  This tests the runtime's basic ability to copy live values
between the source and destination stack.  This test is more for determining
how long it takes to rewrite a larger stack frame, and less about correctness.

Note: there is no default expected output besides timing information.
