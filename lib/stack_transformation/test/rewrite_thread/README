This test spawns a thread, which does the normal recursion/rewrite/return
procedure.  This tests the runtime's ability to transform spawned thread
stacks, and in particular, the runtime's ability to detect the thread's
starting function.

Expected output for default run:
--------------------------------

--> child beginning re-write <--
<timing information>
--> child finished re-write <--
