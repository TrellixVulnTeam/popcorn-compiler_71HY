This test uses a live double-precision floating-point value before and after
the call chain in recurse().  Similarly to rewrite_copy, this tests the
runtime's ability to transfer live values from source to destination, but for
floating-point registers.

Note: this *may* be broken on PowerPC -- it segfaults when running inside QEMU
      but runs correctly natively

Expected output for default run:
