- Put all ident_t pointers on the same page (may read flags field) -- should be
  read-only
  - Looks like clang allocates stack space for ident_t, copies them into local
    stack space & passes alloca address to runtime -- why???

- Correctly implement page fault probing/cross-node execution decisions for
  dynamic scheduler
  - Some benchmarks may not have enough parallelism to work well with the
    hetprobe (i.e., probing takes > 25% of total iterations) so we may degrade
    to dynamic scheduler.  However we should still measure page faults and
    make a cross-node decision.

- Parallel region start optimization (hierarchy_init_node_team_state()/
  hierarchy_init_thread()) doesn't allow adjusting per-node thread counts to,
  for example, change to single-node execution after probing period
