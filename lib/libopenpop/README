Overview

The Popcorn Distributed OpenMP runtime ("libopenpop") is an OpenMP 4.5
compliant runtime for multithreading on Popcorn Linux.  In particular
libopenpop is designed to allow developers to seamlessly scale threads out
across multiple machines in a cluster using the familiar OpenMP API [1].

The library is a fork of the GNU OpenMP Library ("libgomp") released with GCC
version 7.2.0 -- see the COPYING files for license information.  While the
library supports all OpenMP 4.5 features (including offloading), not all OpenMP
4.5 features are allowed when used on Popcorn Linux; for example, threads
cannot use offloading features.
