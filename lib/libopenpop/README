Overview
--------

The Popcorn Distributed OpenMP runtime ("libopenpop") is an OpenMP 4.5
compliant runtime for multithreading on Popcorn Linux.  In particular
libopenpop is designed to allow developers to seamlessly scale threads out
across multiple machines in a cluster using the familiar OpenMP API [1].

The library is a fork of the GNU OpenMP Library ("libgomp") released with GCC
version 7.2.0 -- see the COPYING files for license information.  While the
library supports all OpenMP 4.5 features (including offloading), not all OpenMP
4.5 features are allowed when used on Popcorn Linux; for example, threads
cannot use offloading features.

Environment Variables
---------------------

libopenpop defaults to single-node execution.  Users can configure distributed
execution using the following environment variables.

POPCORN_PLACES : string
-----------------------

Comma-separated list specifying where to place OpenMP team threads.  To place
an identical number of threads on each node, use the "node" keyword like so:

OMP_NUM_THREADS=24 POPCORN_PLACES="nodes(8)" ...

This spawns 24 threads and puts 8 threads on each node.  Alternatively if the
user would like to place differing numbers of threads on each node they can
put the thread count for each node in curly-braces like so:

OMP_NUM_THREADS=112 POPCORN_PLACES="{16},{96}" ...

This places threads 0-15 on node zero and threads 16-95 on node 1.

POPCORN_HYBRID_BARRIER : boolean
--------------------------------

Flag setting whether to use multi-node optimized barrier.  Defaults to true
when distributing threads across nodes.

POPCORN_HYBRID_REDUCE : boolean
-------------------------------

Flag setting whether to use multi-node optimized reductions.  Defaults to true
when distributing threads across nodes.

POPCORN_HET_WORKSHARE : string
------------------------------

Comma-separated list specifying how to skew loop iteration distribution for
work-sharing regions.  For example, to give threads on node 0 three times as
many loop iterations as those on node 1:

POPCORN_HET_WORKSHARE={3},{1} ...

Note: only applies to for-loops using the "static" loop iteration scheduler

POPCORN_PROBE_PERCENT : float
-----------------------------

Percent of loop iterations in a work-sharing region to be used for the probing
phase of the HetProbe scheduler.  Must be between 0.0 (0%) and 1.0 (100%).

Note: only applies to for-loops using the "hetprobe" loop iteration scheduler

POPCORN_MAX_PROBES : integer
----------------------------

Because the probing phase has overhead, only probe a work sharing region this
number of times before caching and re-using the result for all subsequent
visits to the region.

Note: only applies to for-loops using the "hetprobe" loop iteration scheduler

The following environment variables are implementation hacks that exist until
the HetProbe scheduler takes on more autonomy and reading performance counters
is introduced into libopenpop.

POPCORN_PRIME_REGION : string
-----------------------------

Identifier for the region which should be used to make all work-sharing
distribution decisions.  clang's own internal identifier.

Note: only applies to for-loops using the "hetprobe" loop iteration scheduler

POPCORN_PREFERRED_NODE : integer
--------------------------------

Which node should be used for single-node execution if the HetProbe scheduler
decides cross-node execution is too expensive.

Note: only applies to for-loops using the "hetprobe" loop iteration scheduler
