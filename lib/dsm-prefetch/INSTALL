Installing libdsm-prefetch
--------------------------

The libdsm-prefetch library is an optional library used to optimizing memory
placement in a cluster Popcorn setting.  The Makefile will handle building and
installing the library for all architectures.

NOTE: libdsm-prefetch is built against Popcorn's musl-libc.  Please install it
for all architectures in /usr/local/popcorn/<arch> before continuing -- it is
important to compile against musl-libc, otherwise the compiler will default to
compiling against glibc and glibc-specific symbols will creep into the library.
This will lead to undefined/unresolved symbols when compiling applications.

1. Build & install libmigration for aarch64 & x86_64:

  $ make install

2. You can speed up the build by enabling parallel jobs:

  $ make -j<# of parallel jobs>

3. The library can be built in several different configurations:

  - Debug: check invariants with assertions & print out memory ranges being
    batched/prefetched by the library.

  $ make type=debug

  - Manual prefetching in userspace: rather than using madvise() to inform the
    kernel of memory ranges to prefetch, create per-node worker threads to
    force DSM prefetching by manually touching pages in userspace.

  $ make type=manual

  - Statistics: record information about the number of pages prefetched and the
    time to prefetch.

  $ make type=statistics
