Overview

The distributed shared memory (DSM) prefetching library is responsible for
batching and issuing prefetching requests from applications.  This allows
optimizing the time it takes to bring memory across nodes for distributed
execution.  In other words, this library gives applications an API to inform
the kernel which threads are going to be accessing what memory on which nodes.
The kernel ingests this information and will make a best-effort attempt to
place the requested data on separate nodes.

Note that this library does *not* change application semantics, it is simply a
means to give hints to the DSM layer to optimize memory layout in a cluster
Popcorn setting.
