Please follow the following procedures for reporting bugs about the compiler
and runtimes.  You can report bugs at
https://github.com/ssrg-vt/popcorn-compiler/issues and assign them to rlyerly.

--------
Compiler
--------

When you should report this type of bug:

- When I compile using clang with "-popcorn-migratable", the compiler crashes
- When I compile using clang with "-popcorn-migratable", the compiler spits out
  arcane errors or warnings related to live values, stackmaps, or stack
  transformation

When you should *not* report this type of bug:

- When I compile using clang with or without "-popcorn-migratable", the
  compiler crashes.

    - This is a clang/LLVM problem, not a Popcorn compiler one!

What you should include with your bug report:

- Branch & commit from which you installed the compiler

- *Minimal* working code sample (should compile without "-popcorn-migratable"),
  including detailed directions for reproducing the bug

  - If you built clang/LLVM with debugging information, the compiler will spit
    out a preprocessed source file and shell script if it crashes, e.g.:

    PLEASE ATTACH THE FOLLOWING FILES TO THE BUG REPORT:
    Preprocessed source(s) and associated run script(s) are located at:
    clang-3.7: note: diagnostic msg: /tmp/<file>.c
    clang-3.7: note: diagnostic msg: /tmp/<file>.sh
    clang-3.7: note: diagnostic msg:

    This makes it very easy to reproduce the bug, so please use this output if
    available.

- Behavior of the bug, including any warnings or errors dumped by clang

- Compiler output when adding the following flags (note that it may produce a
  very large file):

  -mllvm -debug-only=regalloc -mllvm -debug-only=stacktransform

-------
Runtime
-------

When you should report this type of bug:

- When I run the application, it segfaults or otherwise exits inside of the
  must-libc startup or exit code
- When I run the application and attempt to perform a migration, it dies
  during stack transformation
- When I run the application and attempt to perform a migration, it dies
  after migration

When you need to do more investigation before reporting:

- When I run the application without migrating, the application dies
  prematurely *after* starting the main() function

  - You need to compile the application using clang without
    "-popcorn-migratable".  One of two situations that will arise:

    1. Without "-popcorn-migratable", the application compiles & runs
       correctly. This is a Popcorn compiler bug and should be reported.

    2. Even without "-popcorn-migratable", the application either doesn't
       compile or doesn't run correctly.

        - This is a clang/LLVM problem, not a Popcorn compiler one!

What you should report with this bug:

- Branch & commit from which you installed the compiler

- *Minimal* working code sample for reproducing the bug, including detailed
  directions for compiling and running the application in order to reproduce
  the bug

- Behavior of the bug, including any output from the application

- Stack transformation log

    - Note: you may need to reinstall the runtime with
      "--debug-stack-transformation" in order to generate the log

- Any kernel output in dmesg related to thread or page migration, especially if
  the application successfully migrated
