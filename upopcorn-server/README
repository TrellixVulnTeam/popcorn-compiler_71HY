All servers needs to be described in a file: "~/.popcorn".

Example for a two x86_64 configuration file use the following:
10.4.4.32;X86_64
10.4.4.32;X86_64

Example for a two heterogeneous system use the following:
10.1.1.32;X86_64
10.1.1.51;AARCH64

To run on the local machine use the following:
127.0.0.1;X86_64
127.0.0.1;X86_64
