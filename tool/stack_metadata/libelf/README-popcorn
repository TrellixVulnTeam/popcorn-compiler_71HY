libelf, released under GNU Library GPLv2 and downloaded from
http://www.mr511.de/software/english.html

--------
Overview
--------

The libelf library is used by libdwarf, the stack transformation metadata
generation tool, and the stack transformation runtime to read and modify ELF
files.  The libdwarf library uses libelf for accessing the DWARF debugging
sections of ELF object files.  The stack transformation metadata generation
tool uses libelf to add several ELF sections containing cross-architecture
location mapping information and live value location information at those
locations.  The stack transformation runtime uses libelf to read this generated
metadata to correlate return addresses when rewriting and to locate live
values.

We use libelf mostly unmodified, except for a couple of changes in the build
procedure to cross-compile for aarch64. The other modification is the bugfix
for ignoring file open permission during mmap, which is solved by commit
#32761f7.
