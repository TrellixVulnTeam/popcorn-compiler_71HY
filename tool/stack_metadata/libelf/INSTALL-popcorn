Installing libelf
-----------------

The libelf library is needed by the stack transformation runtime, and therefore
needs to be compiled for all architectures in the system.

NOTE: libelf is built against Popcorn's musl-libc.  Please install musl-libc
for all architectures in /usr/local/popcorn/<arch> before continuing -- it is
important to compile against musl-libc, otherwise gcc will default to compiling
against glibc and glibc-specific symbols will creep into the library.  This
will lead to undefined/unresolved symbols when compiling applications.

NOTE: do a "make distclean" in-between building for individual architectures

1. Build & install libelf for aarch64:

  $ CFLAGS="-O3 -ffunction-sections -fdata-sections -specs /usr/local/popcorn/aarch64/lib/musl-gcc.specs" ./configure --host=aarch64-linux-gnu --prefix=/usr/local/popcorn/aarch64 --enable-elf64 --disable-shared --enable-extended-format
  $ make install

2. Build & install libelf for x86_64:

  $ make distclean
  $ CFLAGS="-O3 -ffunction-sections -fdata-sections -specs /usr/local/popcorn/x86_64/lib/musl-gcc.specs" ./configure  --prefix=/usr/local/popcorn/x86_64 --enable-elf64 --disable-shared --enable-extended-format
  $ make install

3. You can speed the build up by enabling parallel jobs:

  $ make -j<# of parallel jobs> install
