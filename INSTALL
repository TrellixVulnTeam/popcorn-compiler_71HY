Popcorn Compiler Toolchain Installation

---------------
Getting started
---------------

The toolchain will be installed at /usr/local/popcorn.  After the toolchain has
been installed, add /usr/local/popcorn/bin to PATH and /usr/local/popcorn/lib
to LD_LIBRARY_PATH so that the correct compiler and libraries are used when
building multi-ISA binaries (alternatively, hard-code these locations into your
build procedure).

Note: if you have a previous clang/LLVM installation or binutils installation,
adding /usr/local/popcorn/* to environment variables may shadow previous
installations!

------------------
Installation order
------------------

There are many components that need to be installed, and several prerequisites
between components, so components should be installed in the following order:

1. Download/patch/install clang/LLVM - see patches/llvm
2. Download/patch/install binutils - see patches/binutils-gold
3. Install LLVM passes - see lib/passes
4. Install architecture-specific libraries
  - see lib/musl-1.1.10
  - see lib/libelf
  - see lib/libdwarf
  - see lib/libbomp
  - see lib/stack_transformation
  - see lib/migration
5. Install alignment tool - see tool/alignment
6. Install stack transformation metadata tool - see tool/stack_metadata
7. (Optional) Install call information library - see lib/stack_depth

See the INSTALL file in each subdirectory for more details.

-------------------
Installation Script
-------------------

To install the compiler and all necessary libraries use the following command:
$ ./install_compiler.py

The default installation directory is "/usr/local/popcorn/"

WARNINIG: It's not recommanded to use alternative paths. Even if the script supports it, 
since some tools still depends on the default path.

-----------------
User Mode Install
-----------------

To avoid compiling as root, one create a symbolic link folder. For example:
$ mkdir $(pwd)/install
$ sudo ln -s $(pwd)/install /usr/local/popcorn

This will install everything under the "$(pwd)/install" directory.
