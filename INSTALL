Popcorn Compiler Toolchain Installation

---------------
Getting started
---------------

The toolchain will be installed at /usr/local/popcorn.  After the toolchain has
been installed, add /usr/local/popcorn/bin to PATH and /usr/local/popcorn/lib
to LD_LIBRARY_PATH so that the correct compiler and libraries are used when
building multi-ISA binaries (alternatively, hard-code these locations into your
build procedure).

Note: if you have a previous clang/LLVM installation or binutils installation,
adding /usr/local/popcorn/* to environment variables may shadow previous
installations!

------------------
